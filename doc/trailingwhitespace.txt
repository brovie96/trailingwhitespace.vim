The highlighting provided by this plugin only works if `:syntax enable` has
been called (most plugin managers do this or require you to do this anyway).
See |:syntax-enable| for details on this.

BASICS                                              *trailingwhitespace*

This plugin allows you to see trailing whitespace at the end of a line while
you are editing a buffer. By default, trailing whitespace is highlighted in
the ErrorMsg color, but you can change it by changing highlighting for the
TrailingWhitespace group. See |:highlight| for details on how to do this.

                                                    *trailingwhitespace-clear*
This plugin also exposes a trailingwhitespace#ClearTrailingWhitespace()
function, which will remove all trailing whitespace from the current buffer.
You can use this by `:nnoremap`-ing (or similar) a keystroke to call this
function. For example:
>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>w :call trailingwhitespace#ClearTrailingWhitespace()<cr>
<
This function gives similar feedback to the `:substitute` command, in the
bottom line (where commands are typed). For long files, it will print a
message while it is working.
