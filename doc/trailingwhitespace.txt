The highlighting provided by this plugin only works if `:syntax enable` has
been called (most plugin managers do this or require you to do this anyway).
See |:syntax-enable| for details on this.

BASICS~

This plugin allows you to see trailing whitespace at the end of a line while
you are editing a buffer. By default, trailing whitespace is highlighted in
the ErrorMsg color, but you can change it by changing highlighting for the
TrailingWhitespace group. See |:highlight| for details on how to do this.

trailingwhitespace#ClearTrailingWhitespace()~

This plugin also includes an autoload function which will remove all trailing
whitespace from the current buffer. On Unix platforms, this uses sed (making
it rather fast, even on very large files), while on other platforms it falls
back to a slower but still effective vimscript implementation. You can use
this function by using `:nnoremap` or a similar command in your Vim config to
map a key sequence to call this function. For example:
>
    nnoremap <silent> <leader>w :call trailingwhitespace#ClearTrailingWhitespace()<cr>
<
This function gives similar feedback to the `:substitute` command, in the
bottom line (where commands are typed). For long buffers, it will print a
message while it is working.
